# Creating and timing algorithms.

Contains a numbers file which contains graphs for testing last, reverse, sort and shuffle algorithms (given in Collections rather than ones I have written myself).

Contains code for an algorithm I have writen which takes an Arraylist of ints, and checks if there are any suplicates and returns an array of the duplicates.

Have started on a merge sort but tbc.
